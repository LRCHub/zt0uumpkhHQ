When we first met, you used to call me baby
You said you love me, now I barely hear a word you're sayin'
And when your friends ask if you and me are datin'
You're lookin' guilty, shufflin' your feet and hesitatin'

Well, fuck that, I don't need that
Don't want it to get out?
Well, you should be damn proud
It's gettin' dark here, sitting in your closet
With your other skeletons, like I'm some kind of secret

Don't wanna be your undercover lover
Don't wanna be your friend
And kiss you when the night ends
Don't wanna be your dirty little secret
I want the world to know whose hotel you go to

Don't understand why you wanna keep it quiet
If it was me, I'd be startin' fuckin' riots
If you can't handle who I am, then get the fuck out
I'm not hangin' around for somethin' I could do without

I will admit that from the very beginning
You said you didn't wanna give a reason for gossiping
I just feel like a puppet with a mouthpiece
So, won't you cut the strings, so I can stop pretending?

Don't wanna be your undercover lover
Don't wanna be your friend
And kiss you when the night ends
Don't wanna be your dirty little secret
I want the world to know whose hotel you go to

Don't understand why you wanna keep it quiet
If it was me, I'd be startin' fuckin' riots
If you can't handle who I am, then get the fuck out
I'm not hangin' around for somethin' I could do without

Don't wanna be your undercover lover
Don't wanna be your friend
And kiss you when the night ends
Don't wanna be your dirty little secret
I want the world to know
(I want the world to know)

Don't wanna be your undercover lover
Don't wanna be your friend
And kiss you when the night ends
Don't wanna be your dirty little secret
I want the world to know whose hotel you go to

Don't understand why you wanna keep it quiet
If it was me, I'd be startin' fuckin' riots
If you can't handle who I am, then get the fuck out!
I'm not hangin' around for someone I could do without
