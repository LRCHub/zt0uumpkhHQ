Rebel inside
She's always in disguise
Destimed to kill
What she tought was real
Yeah she's a high-class baby
With some attitude
She's wicked and wild
And makes you go blind an grind

She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's talking you high
And makes your heartbeat stop
She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's making you fly
And head go round and round
She's undercover girl
She's undercover girl

Uptown angel
Fancy neighbourhood
Overprotected
Always knew what's good
Now she has black boots
And the long blod hair
She steps in the room
And men turn to lousy fools

She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's talking you high
And makes your heartbeat stop
She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's making you fly
And head go round and round
She's undercover girl
She's undercover girl

She's talking you high
And makes your heartbeat stop
She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's making you fly
And head go round and round
She's undercover girl

She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's talking you high
And makes your heartbeat stop
She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's making you fly
And head go round and round

She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's talking you high
And makes your heartbeat stop
She's undercover girl
That's all she's got
She's making you fly
And head go round and round
