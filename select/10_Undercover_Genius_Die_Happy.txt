Damn, I'm the man
I'm smarter than you and you can't denny it
I'll get what I deserve
Your selling your soul, I'm not gonna buy it
And it's a shame that you don't like me
'Cause I'm your greatest fan
You'll always be one step behind me
Catch me if you can

A choir of angel singing my praise
Soothing my anger
Easing my pain

I'm better than the rest
I'm an undercover genius
I must confess
It's getting kind of serious
I'm better than the rest
No one is ever gonna bring me down
This is my quest
A king without a crown

Damn, what a scam
It's ridiculous how u bathe in glory
Your are an egoist
One of these days your are gonna be sorry
So don't pretend that you don't owe me
I'm gonna make you pay
'Cause you are nobody without me
No matter what you say

Standing in your own way
Failing in your vain crusade
And now you're alone
A lonely king upon his throne
You should never deceive yourself
It's only make-believe

...Rest
You're an ordinary, average guy
You must confess
It's time for you to step aside
You're not better than the rest
You're a schizophrenic little man
You're an egoist
Making trouble anyway you can
