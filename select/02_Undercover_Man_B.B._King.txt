Here's a story how it goes
Or so they say
How a girl came along
Took a young boy and stole him away

(But) She loved him so
Treated him nice
They fell in love once
And they fell in love twice
Nothing went to waste, no
Not one little taste

So whatever you decide
Baby's (Honey's) all right with me
I'll understand
Wanna be your undercover man
Undercover man

So that's the story how it goes
Or so they say
How a girl came along
Took a young boy and stole him away
Said they was crazy
When they jumped the fence
They (ain't) never been seen
Or heard of since
Nothing went to waste, no
Not one little taste

So whatever you decide
Baby's (Honey's) all right with me
I'll understand
Wanna be your undercover man
Undercover man
