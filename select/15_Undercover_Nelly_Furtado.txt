Yeah, I like your style
Coming at me, coming at me, coming all the while, and
And I like to stare
When you walk by, when you walk by
There's something in the air, yeah
And I like to wave (Wave)
Oh, I never seen myself in such a crazy
I'm not insane
But I already have your number and I know your name, and

I think I'd like to know you
But then maybe I'd see right through you
I'd kinda like to get to know you
But then maybe, baby, I'd see right through you

Why you got your head down
Why you looking at the ground
Shifting your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Why you wanna get away
I'm onto your games
Everything you say
Is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on running
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumping
You've got another lover
You're still undercover

And you look so good
I like you so bad I gotta knock on wood, yeah
You know I want you
So you keep me hanging in the ring, you know you do
That's how you play (Play)
I don't care cos I'll be here anyway, and
I'll play your game
As long as I can win it at the end of the day, and

I think I'd like to know you
But then maybe I'd see right through you
I'd kinda like to get to know you
But then maybe, baby, I'd see right through you

Why you got your head down
Why you looking at the ground
Shifting your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Why you wanna get away
I'm onto your games
Everything you say
Is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on running
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumping
You've got another lover
You're still undercover

Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner
Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner
Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner
You turn your head around like you was a transformer
Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner (Watch it now)
Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner (Watch it now)
Watch, watch it now, watch it come around the corner (Watch it now)
Turn my head around like I was a transformer

Why you got your head down
Why you looking at the ground
Shifting your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Why you wanna get away
I'm onto your games
Everything you say
Is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on running
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumping

Why you got your head down
Why you looking at the ground
Shifting your eyes away
I wanna talk straight
Why you wanna get away
I'm onto your games
Everything you say
Is old and late
I can't get in if you keep on running
I can't get in if your heart keeps jumping
You've got another lover
You're still undercover

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm not the only one
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm not the only one
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm not the only one
The only one
